## 🚨 CRITICAL: You Must Run Database Migrations

Your database needs two new migrations to make this work:

### **Migration 1: Media Libraries**
📄 File: `supabase/migrations/002_create_media_libraries.sql`

**Purpose**: Creates tables for music_library, images_library, videos_library

**How to run:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Open `002_create_media_libraries.sql` from your project
5. Copy/paste the entire file
6. Click **Run**

### **Migration 2: Combined Media Library** ⭐ NEW
📄 File: `supabase/migrations/003_create_combined_media_library.sql`

**Purpose**: Creates combined_media_library table for saved combinations

**How to run:**
1. Same steps as above
2. Use `003_create_combined_media_library.sql` this time
3. Click **Run**

⚠️ **Without these migrations, the library features won't work!**

## 🎯 Test the Complete Flow

Once migrations are run, test this end-to-end:

### Step 1: Generate Content
1. Go to homepage
2. Generate a music track (2 credits)
3. Generate cover art (1 credit)
4. ✅ Both should auto-save to library

### Step 2: View Library
1. Click "Library" in navigation
2. Check **Music** tab - your track should appear
3. Check **Images** tab - your cover art should appear
4. ✅ Play, download, delete buttons work

### Step 3: Combine Media
1. Click "Combine Media" button on homepage
2. Select your music track
3. Select your cover art
4. Click "Combine"
5. ✅ You'll see: "Media combined and saved to your library!"

### Step 4: Publish to Label
1. Go to **Library > Combined** tab
2. You should see your combined media
3. Click **"Send to Label"** button
4. ✅ Confirm: "Publish this to your profile?"
5. ✅ Success: "Published to your profile! It will appear in Explore."

### Step 5: Verify Publication
1. Go to **Explore** page
2. ✅ Your combined media should appear
3. ✅ Badge shows "✓ Published"

## 🚀 What's Next (Future Phases)

### Phase 3: Label System
- User can create custom labels (e.g., "Dark Beats Records")
- Each label has: name, bio, banner, theme color
- Published media can be assigned to specific labels
- Public label pages: `/label/[slug]`

### Phase 4: Releases System
- Bundle multiple tracks into albums/EPs
- Release metadata: title, description, release date
- Pre-save campaigns
- Release calendar

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Collaborative labels (multi-user)
- Label analytics (plays, downloads, fans)
- Revenue tracking (if you add monetization)
- Distribution to streaming platforms

## 📝 Current Status

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: R2 storage + auto-save to library
✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Combined media library + "Send to Label"

**Next**: Run migrations, test the flow, then start Phase 3 (Label system)

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test with real credits** - Make sure generation + library saving works
2. **Check R2 storage** - Permanent URLs should not expire
3. **Monitor Supabase** - Check tables are populating correctly
4. **User feedback** - The "Send to Label" flow is smooth and clear

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Combined media not showing in library"
→ Run migration `003_create_combined_media_library.sql`

### "Can't combine media"
→ Make sure you have items in Music and Images tabs first

### "Send to Label button not working"
→ Check browser console for API errors
→ Verify `combined_media` table exists (for Explore page)

### "Items not auto-saving after generation"
→ Run migration `002_create_media_libraries.sql`
→ Check API endpoints are calling library save

## 📞 Need Help?

If something's not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase SQL Editor for table structure
3. Verify all 3 migrations have been run
4. Test with a fresh music + image generation

**Ready to test!** 🎉

Run those migrations and enjoy your complete library system with publishing to profile! 🚀
