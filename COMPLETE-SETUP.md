   - Other users' searches
4. Still shows in creator's profile

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Data Display (IMMEDIATE)
The pages exist but need to fetch and display data:
1. ✅ Create API routes (done)
2. ⏳ Connect Explore page to API

4. ⏳ Connect Billboard page to API
5. ⏳ Add loading states
6. ⏳ Add empty states

### Phase 2: Audio Playback
- Create global audio player
- Play/pause controls
- Track progress bar
- Queue system

### Phase 3: Social Interactions
- Like button
- Comment system
- Follow/unfollow users
- Share functionality

### Phase 4: Polish
- Download tracks (audio + cover)
- Share to social media
- Notifications

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Errors ✅
**Problem:** API routes blocked by CORS
**Solution:** Created CORS middleware in `lib/cors.ts`
- Added OPTIONS handlers
- Added CORS headers to all responses

### 2. 500 Errors ✅
**Problem:** Supabase anon key has no permissions
**Solution:** Use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for all server-side operations
- Updated all API routes
- Proper authentication flow

### 3. Generation Tracking ✅
**Problem:** No way to track AI progress
**Solution:** Replicate Predictions API
- `predictions.create()` - Start generation
- `predictions.get()` - Poll for status
- Proper error handling
