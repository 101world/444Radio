# 🎵 AudioMass Integration Fixed + ACE-Step Language Support Complete

## 🎉 What Just Happened

You encountered errors when clicking the Studio page because AudioMass wasn't being loaded properly. I've **completely fixed the integration** and added **full multi-language AI music generation support**!

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **AudioMass Loading Errors** ❌ → ✅
**Error You Saw:**
```
PKAudioEditor is not defined
q._deps.ui is not a constructor
Failed to init AudioMass
```

**Root Cause:** 
- AudioMass requires ALL its dependencies loaded in specific order
- The `/studio/daw` page was trying to use AudioMass in React but not loading the actual AudioMass files

**Solution:**
- ✅ Copied ALL AudioMass files from `vendor/444studio/src/` to `public/studio/`
- ✅ Created `/studio/editor` page that properly serves AudioMass via iframe
- ✅ Added 444Radio branding wrapper (top/bottom bars)
- ✅ All dependencies now load correctly: `app.js`, `engine.js`, `ui.js`, `actions.js`, `wavesurfer.js`, etc.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### AudioMass Integration Method:
- **Static Files:** Served from `/public/studio/` (not processed by Next.js)
- **Access:** Via iframe at `/studio/editor` for clean separation
- **Dependencies:** All loaded in correct order (wavesurfer, plugins, engine, UI)
- **Permissions:** Microphone + clipboard access enabled

### API Flow:
```
User selects language → MusicGenerationModal checks isEnglish
  ↓
English = true  → Use MiniMax Music 1.5 (bitrate, sample_rate, audio_format)
English = false → Use ACE-Step (audio_length_in_s, num_inference_steps, guidance_scale, denoising_strength)
  ↓
API receives params → Calls correct Replicate model → Returns audio URL
```

### Language Hook System:
```typescript
// lib/language-hooks.ts exports:
LANGUAGE_HOOKS: { chinese: {...}, japanese: {...}, ... }
getLanguageHook(language)
getAllLanguages()
getGenresForLanguage(language)
getSamplePromptsForLanguage(language)
getLyricsStructureForLanguage(language)
```
