## üö® TRUTH: What You're Actually Seeing vs What I Said

### Profile Page Issue
**You Said**: "I still see vinyl player, Recent Tracks"  
**What's Actually There**:
- ‚úÖ Banner/Carousel at top
- ‚úÖ "üéµ Recent Tracks" horizontal scroll
- ‚úÖ "üìÄ All Tracks" tab
- ‚úÖ Plays/Likes ARE in the code (lines 1073-1083)
- ‚ùì **BUT** they might not be VISIBLE because:
  1. **Database migrations weren't run** - `likes` column doesn't exist yet
  2. **All counters are 0** - no actual play/like data
  3. **Browser cache** - showing old version

**Solution**: Run migrations first (see below)

---

### Explore Page Issue  
**You Said**: "I don't see plays/likes on each track"  
**Truth**: You were 100% RIGHT - they weren't there  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **JUST FIXED** (commit 3e26cd7) - now shows play counts

---

### Studio Page Confusion
**What You Asked**: "Where is the studio page? Why haven't you forked AudioMass?"  
**What Actually Exists**:

#### ‚úÖ What's Live:
1. **`/studio`** - Redirects to `/studio/audiomass`
2. **`/studio/audiomass`** - iFrame embedding AudioMass.co + upload form
3. **`/studio/native`** - Basic multi-track Web Audio proof-of-concept (NEW, just pushed)
4. **`/studio/opendaw`** - iFrame embedding OpenDAW
5. **`vendor/audiomass/`** - AudioMass source code as Git submodule

#### ‚ùå What DOESN'T Exist Yet:
1. **Forked AudioMass repo under your account** - Submodule points to original repo
2. **Native AudioMass integration** - Code is there but not wired into UI
3. **Production-ready DAW with timeline/waveforms** - `/studio/native` is basic

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO THIS FIRST**

The profile/explore pages won't show plays/likes until you run migrations.

```powershell
# In PowerShell at C:\444Radio
$env:PG_CONNECTION_STRING = "your-supabase-connection-string"
npm run migrate
```

**Get your connection string**:
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Connection String
3. Use the "Session pooler" one (port 6543)
4. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual password

**Expected output**:
```
‚úì 001_add_last_444_radio_date.sql
‚úì 002_add_likes_to_combined_media.sql  ‚Üê THIS ONE ADDS likes COLUMN
‚úì 003_add_banner_to_users.sql
‚úì 004_create_studio_projects.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Migrations Worked

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'combined_media' 
AND column_name IN ('plays', 'likes');
```

Should show both columns.

### Step 3: Add Test Data

```sql
-- Give your tracks some plays/likes to see them appear
UPDATE combined_media 
SET plays = 150, likes = 42 
WHERE user_id = 'your_clerk_user_id' 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Browser

- Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + F5`
- Or: Clear cache completely

## üìã What Each Studio Page Actually Does

### `/studio` (or just click "Studio" link)
- **What it does**: Redirects to `/studio/audiomass`
- **Why**: Main entry point

### `/studio/audiomass`
- **What it does**: Shows AudioMass.co website in an iframe + upload form below
- **How to use**:
  1. Edit audio in the iframe
  2. Export from AudioMass (Download button)
  3. Fill form below with title + select exported file
  4. Click "Upload to Library"
  5. Redirects to `/library`
- **Limitation**: It's just an iframe, not native

### `/studio/native`
- **What it does**: Basic multi-track DAW I just built
  - Drag audio from "Your Library" sidebar into track lanes
  - Or drop local audio files
  - Per-track mute/solo/volume
  - Basic Play/Stop transport
  - Save project (stores track config to DB)
- **Limitation**: No waveform display, no timeline editing, no effects

### `/studio/opendaw`
- **What it does**: Shows OpenDAW in an iframe
- **Why it exists**: Alternative option (GPLv3 license though)

## üéØ What SHOULD Happen Next (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Get Current Features Working (YOU DO THIS)
1. ‚úÖ **Run migrations** (fixes plays/likes display)
2. ‚úÖ **Test explore page** - plays counter should now show (just fixed)
3. ‚úÖ **Test profile page** - plays/likes should show after migration
4. ‚úÖ **Test `/studio/audiomass`** - upload workflow should work

### Priority 2: Fork AudioMass (I GUIDE YOU)
AudioMass is at `vendor/audiomass` but points to original repo. To fork:

**Manual Fork via GitHub**:
1. Go to https://github.com/pkalogiros/AudioMass
2. Click "Fork" button (top right)
3. Fork to your account (101world/AudioMass)
4. Come back and I'll update the submodule to point to your fork

**OR I can do it via CLI if you have GitHub CLI installed**:
```powershell
gh repo fork pkalogiros/AudioMass --clone=false
```

### Priority 3: Native AudioMass Integration (WE DO TOGETHER)
Once forked:
1. Build a React component that imports AudioMass engine directly
2. Replace the iframe with native timeline/waveform display
3. Add drag-and-drop from library sidebar
4. Wire AI generation sidebar
5. Apply 444 glassmorphism theme

## üé¨ Next Steps (Let's Be Clear)

### What I Need From You:
1. **Run the migration command above** with your Supabase connection string
2. **Tell me if you see plays/likes after migration**
3. **Decide**: Do you want me to fork AudioMass to your account? (Yes/No)
4. **Screenshot**: Show me what `/studio/audiomass` looks like on your screen

### What I'll Do Next:
1. **Check `/library` page** and add plays/likes if missing
2. **Help you fork AudioMass** if you want
3. **Build native AudioMass integration** if you confirm the fork
4. **OR stick with iframe approach** if that's good enough

## üí¨ Let's Get On the Same Page

I'll stop making assumptions and work on exactly what you need. üéØ
