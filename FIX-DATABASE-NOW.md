## What This Migration Does

✅ Adds `is_public` column to songs (fixes the error)
✅ Adds `username` column to users
✅ Adds `username` column to songs  
✅ Generates usernames for all existing users
✅ Creates indexes for fast queries
✅ Sets up auto-sync triggers

---

## If You See Any Errors

### Error: "column already exists"
✅ **This is fine!** The migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` - it will skip columns that already exist.

### Error: "permission denied"
❌ Make sure you're using the Supabase dashboard (not a different SQL client)

### Error: "relation does not exist"
❌ Make sure your tables are created. Run `supabase-schema.sql` first.

---

## After Migration

Your site will have:
- ✅ Cover art generation working
- ✅ Music generation working
- ✅ Username-based profiles at `/u/username`
- ✅ Privacy controls (public/private songs)
- ✅ All songs default to PRIVATE 🔒

## Don't Forget!

This migration only needs to run **ONCE**. After it completes successfully, you're done!

🚀 **Ready to create!**
