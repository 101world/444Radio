Memories fade too soon

Late night thoughts keep me awake
Wondering about the choices that I make
Photographs of better days
Echo through this empty space

I'm lost in yesterday
Can't find my way
These feelings won't fade away
Won't fade away

Rain against my window pane
Matches tears I can't explain
Holding onto what remains
Of a love that bears your name

Grinding every day, putting in that work
All the haters talk but I let my actions speak first

We on top now, can't stop now
Living loud, making moves, show me how
Breaking through, breaking rules, breaking ground
This our time, this our town, hear that sound

Now they all watch, want to live like me
But they don't see the struggle and the fight
All the sleepless hours through the night
