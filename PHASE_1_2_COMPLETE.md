## 🎯 Current User Flow (Working):

```

### 2. **Generate Cover Art**

## 📝 YOU STILL NEED TO DO:

### **CRITICAL: Run Database Migration**

Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/002_create_media_libraries.sql
-- Creates: music_library, images_library, videos_library tables
```

**Steps:**
1. https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. SQL Editor → New Query
4. Copy entire file contents
5. Paste → Click "Run"
6. Verify: "Success. No rows returned"

**Without this migration, the library will be empty!**

## 🚀 Next Phase: Labels & Releases

Once database is migrated, we can build:

### **Phase 3: Label System**
- Create label pages (e.g., `/label/my-beats`)
- Customize branding, colors, bio
- Label management dashboard

### **Phase 4: Releases System**
- Publish combined media as "releases" on labels
- Release = Music + Cover Art + Metadata
- Shows on label page + explore

### **Phase 5: Discovery**

- Filter by genre, tags
- Trending algorithm
